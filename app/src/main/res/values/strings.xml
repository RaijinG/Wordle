    <string name="classic">CLASSIC</string>

    <string name="infinite">INFINITE</string>
    <string name="infinite_description">In this mode, players can keep guessing words continuously until they do not succeed. Score is accumulated with each correct guess, and there\'s no limit to the number of words you can guess.</string>
    <string name="number">NUMBER</string>
    <string name="number_description">Similar to Classic Wordle, but without color-highlighted letters. Instead, players receive feedback in the form of the number of letters guessed correctly and the number of those letters correctly positioned.</string>
